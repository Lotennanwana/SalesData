# SalesData
The code contains some analysis that I performed with the use of SQL (SQLite). 
The database has eight tables that serve to show customers, sales, employees etc. 

The goal of the analysis was to answer three questions:
  Which products should we order more of or less of?
  How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
  How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?
